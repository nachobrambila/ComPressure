    "_ComPressure_ is a game following the design of steam-powered circuits across a grid-like area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundational components include:\n",
    "- `pipes` (path segments)\n",
    "- `steam inlets` (sources)\n",
    "- `valves` (gates)\n",
    "- and the in-place sources and vents (red, blue, green, yellow) built into the boundary of the area\n",
    "\n",
    "As the game progresses, previous designs become usable components that can be placed onto a single grid. This means that the efficiency of previous designs will affect the efficiency of later designs. Additionally, as more custom components are created, they can be used to improve the efficiency of previous designs."
